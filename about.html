<p> 
I grew up in the Houston area and completed my undergraduate work at Houston Baptist University.  While attending medical school at UTMB in Galveston, human behavior became a clear area of interest.  I trained in the psychiatry residency program at the Baylor College of Medicine.  This particular program taught extensively in the psychodynamic aspect of psychiatry along with the biological medical component.  <br><br> I started my first job at the Houston VA Medical Center serving our veterans for 10 years.  Beyond the clinical duties, I served as a faculty member at Baylor to medical students, physician assistant students as well as psychiatric residents.  I co-instructed a psychiatry course at the Texas Womenâ€™s Nursing program.  I also participated in research studies. <br><br> Since leaving the VA, I have been in private practice for over 10 years.  Now with over 20 years of diverse experience, I am quite experienced in treating the severely chronically ill to the general population who suffers from psychiatric conditions that need some help and understanding of their continued stigmatized state. I am certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.
